The `srvyr` package aims to add `dplyr` like syntax to Professor Thomas Lumley's `survey` package. In this vignette we will recreate several examples from Lumley's textbook *Complex Surveys: A Guide to Analysis Using R* using `srvyr`. 

# design_survey

The meat of the `sryvr` package is the `design_survey` function. This is similar to the `svydesign` function from the `survey` package, but with some `dplyr` like functionality. `design_survey` is different from `svydesign` because it supports `magrittr` pipes, it uses bare column names rather than using a "~" before the name of the variable like in the `survey` package, and you can use other `dplyr` verbs like `summarise`, `mutate`, and `group_by`. Here are some basic examples using `design_survey` and the functions `survey_total` and `survey_mean` which are the `srvyr` equivalents of `svytotal` and `svymean` respectively:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(srvyr)
library(survey)
library(pander)
data(api)
# simple random sample
srs_design<-apisrs %>% design_survey(ids=1,fpc=fpc)
srs_design
pander(srs_design %>% summarise(Total=survey_total(enroll)))
pander(srs_design %>% summarise(Mean=survey_mean(enroll)))
# weighted sample
nofpc<-apisrs %>% design_survey(weights=pw)
nofpc
pander(nofpc %>% summarise(Total=survey_total(enroll)))
pander(nofpc %>% summarise(Mean=survey_mean(enroll)))
# stratified sample
strat_design<- apistrat %>% design_survey(strata=stype,fpc=fpc)
strat_design
pander(strat_design %>% summarise(Total=survey_total(enroll)))
pander(strat_design %>% summarise(Mean=survey_mean(enroll)))

# try with mutate
pander(srs_design %>% mutate(apidiff=api00-api99) %>% summarise(Mean=survey_mean(apidiff)))
pander(srs_design %>% mutate(apidiffpercent=(api00-api99)/api99) %>% summarise(Mean=survey_mean(apidiffpercent)))
# try with group_by
pander(strat_design %>% group_by(cname) %>% summarise(Totals=survey_total(enroll)))

```
